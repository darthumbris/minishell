!!!!!!!!parse_input need to be redone to work with the token list.
!!!!!!!Need to do the expansion after the lexer and evaluator.
!!!!need to fix all the built in functions to work with the token list. 
(also maybe split up the built_in_functions files into seperate files for each function)
Also handle the $ sign to get things like echo $? and echo $USER stuff
For the history thing might also need to implement history -c to clear the history?
Make sure that it executes ./minishell in minishell (or other programs)!!!!!
Make the pipe stuff work (especially multiple pipes)
Need to check in the check input for ./ for the relative path execution. ???
Need to fix the evaluator.
Need to handle the return values for the built-in functions (for echo $?) (maybe needs to be saved somewhere)
Need to properly do the execution of commands
Some of the built in functions need NULL protection I think. 
also might need to do some stuff differently in them (stuff like return values etc.)
might be nice to change the makefile so it doesn't need all the SRC_DIR stuff for the SRC files.
need to clean up a lot of includes and maybe some of the functions in the tokenizer folder can be cleared?
or for example: echo "The Computer Name is `scutil --get ComputerName`"
organize some of the files in to folders maybe. 
redirections still needs to be done. need to check for that.
