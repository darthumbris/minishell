Probably need to change the whole check_input function to handle a lot of stuff below this.

For cd might need the chdir function.

For the history thing might also need to implement history -c to clear the history?

Need to check in the check input for ./ for the relative path execution.

Check how to handle quotations like " " and ' '
Also handle the $ sign to get things like echo $? and echo $USER stuff

redirections still needs to be done. need to check for that.

Make the pipe stuff work (especially multiple pipes)

Handle ctrl-\ (might need to properly lock the sigquit stuff)

implent the export unset

implent env (getenv?)
