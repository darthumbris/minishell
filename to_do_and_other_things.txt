Probably need to change the whole check_input function to handle a lot of stuff below this.

For cd might need the chdir function. Need to check if the command is cd for this. Execve does execute it but the change in directory
is only for that process.
cd also won't work do anything if you do for example : cd | ls . it will just do the ls on the current directory.

For the history thing might also need to implement history -c to clear the history?

Need to check in the check input for ./ for the relative path execution.

Check how to handle quotations like " " and ' '
Also handle the $ sign to get things like echo $? and echo $USER stuff
or for example: echo "The Computer Name is `scutil --get ComputerName`"

redirections still needs to be done. need to check for that.

Make the pipe stuff work (especially multiple pipes)

Handle ctrl-\ (might need to properly lock the sigquit stuff maybe sigaction needed)

implent env (getenv?)

implent the export unset

might need to do something for pwd when the directory has been changed (but not sure yet)
