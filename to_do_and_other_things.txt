Probably need to change the whole check_input function to handle a lot of stuff below this.

For the history thing might also need to implement history -c to clear the history?

Need to check in the check input for ./ for the relative path execution.

Check how to handle quotations like " " and ' '
Also handle the $ sign to get things like echo $? and echo $USER stuff
or for example: echo "The Computer Name is `scutil --get ComputerName`"

redirections still needs to be done. need to check for that.

Make the pipe stuff work (especially multiple pipes)

quotes:
"ls -la" will be input as one string to command (in this case it should fail)
'$USER' should be printed as just $USER
"$USER" should print the username

parse_input maybe needs a char **input, where the first string is the command and the other strings are 
the options/arguments ?
than it will just check the first string if it's one of the built ins.

than with | and redirections (< << > >> stuff) we need to check this stuff first

Need to handle the return values for the built-in functions (for echo $?)

Make sure that it executes ./minishell in minishell (or other programs)!!!!!
