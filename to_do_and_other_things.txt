For the history thing might also need to implement history -c to clear the history?

Need to check in the check input for ./ for the relative path execution. ???

redirections still needs to be done. need to check for that.

Make the pipe stuff work (especially multiple pipes)

!!!!!!!!parse_input need to be redone to work with the token list.

Need to handle the return values for the built-in functions (for echo $?) (maybe needs to be saved somewhere)

Make sure that it executes ./minishell in minishell (or other programs)!!!!!

!!!!need to fix all the built in functions to work with the token list. 
also might need to do some stuff differently in them (stuff like return values etc.)

Need to fix the evaluator.

!!!!!!!Need to do the expansion after the lexer and evaluator.
Also handle the $ sign to get things like echo $? and echo $USER stuff
or for example: echo "The Computer Name is `scutil --get ComputerName`"

need to clean up a lot of includes and maybe some of the functions in the tokenizer folder can be cleared?

Need to properly do the execution of commands

Some of the built in functions need NULL protection I think. 

organize some of the files in to folders maybe. 
(also maybe split up the built_in_functions files into seperate files for each function)

might be nice to change the makefile so it doesn't need all the SRC_DIR stuff for the SRC files.
